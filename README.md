**Insights:**
- The **low return rat**e of 0.26% suggests customer satisfaction with product quality. 
- The majority of customers fall within the **U30** age group, are **single**, and have a **median income** *($30K-$70K per year)*. Additionally, the customer base skews slightly **male**.
- The year 2021 marked the highest revenue period, demonstrating strong overall business performance. Every year, revenue tends to experience a slight uptick in the fourth quarter, potentially due to holiday shopping sprees surrounding Thanksgiving, Halloween, and Christmas. However, **profit margins remain relatively consistent** around 60% over time.
- The Bronze customer segment accounts for over 50% of the customer base. Average revenur, profit per customer, and transaction volumes are relatively similar across all segments. Notably, the **Silver segment exhibits the weakest performance** in all metrics &rarr; Company should invest again into how segment customers.
